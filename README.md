# Touple V-313 Ang

A new iOS project.

## Touple

 It's something that allows us to group together related pieces of data that have different data types, and it's as convenient as creating a simple dictionary,
 but it gives you the flexibility of holding different data types and It's not as high effort as creating an entire struct or a class.
 So by using a Swift tuple, we're able to organize related pieces of data that are relatively small.
